$\large{\textbf{Axiom Schema of Comprehenion}}$

If $P$ is a property, then there exist a set $Y$ such that
$$\large
Y=\set{x:P(x)}
$$
However, this principle is **false**.

### Russel's Paradox:
Let $S$ be a set of all and only those sets that don't include themselves, that is
$$\large
S=\set{X:X\notin X}
$$
now the real question: does $S\in S$ ?
if $S\in S$ then $S$ doesn't belong to itself, and if $S\notin S$ then $S$ does belong to itself, either way we get a contradiction.
then we conclude that $Y=\set{X:X\notin X}$ is not a set, and the intuitive notion of a set must be revised.
