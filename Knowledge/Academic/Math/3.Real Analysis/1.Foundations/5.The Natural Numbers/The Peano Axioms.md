The set of natural numbers is constructed using what we call the *piano axioms*, due to [Giuseppe Peano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano) which formalizes the idea that, for each natural number, there is always a next larger natural number.
>[!def|*]
>The Natural Numbers consist of a set $\mathbb{N}$, a unique element $0$. and a function 
>$$ \nu:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}^\times:=\mathbb{N}\backslash\set{0} $$ with the following properties:
>
$(N_0)$  $\nu$ is injective.
>
$(N_1)$  If $N$ is a subset of  $\mathbb{N}$ containing $0$ and if $\nu(n)\in N$ for all $n\in N$, then $N=\mathbb{N}$.
