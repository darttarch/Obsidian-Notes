A $\textbf{function}$ or $\textbf{map}$ is a rule that assigns an element from a set $X$ to a unique element in the set $Y$. usually denoted by:$$\large
f:X\to Y$$
>
$f(x)\in Y$ is called the $\textbf{value}$ of $f$ at $x$.
The set $X$ is called the $\textbf{domain}$ of $f$ and is denoted by $\text{dom}(f)$.
The set $Y$ is called the $\textbf{codomain}$ of $f$.
The set : $$ \text{im}(f):= \{
y\in Y, \ \exists \ x\in X: \ y=f(x) 
\} $$ is called the $\textbf{image}$ of $f$.

>[!example]
>Let $f:\{1,2,3\}\to\{a,b,c,d\}$ be a function.
>$f(1)=a, \ f(2)=b, \ f(3)=b$
>domain: $\{1,2,3\}$
>codomain: $\{a,b,c,d\}$
>image of $f$: $\{a,b\}$
>see how we didn't hit $c$ and $d$.

>[!rmk|*]
>In the example, the set $\{a,b\}$ is called the $\textbf{range}$ of $f$.
