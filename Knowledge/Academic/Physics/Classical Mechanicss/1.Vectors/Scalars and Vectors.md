# Scalars and Vectors

To describe physical phenomena, we use mathematical quantities.  
These quantities come in two fundamental types: **scalars** and **vectors**.

> [!def]
> $\LARGE \textbf{Scalars}$
>
> Scalars are quantities completely described by their **magnitude** (also called size, norm, or modulus).  
>
> Examples: mass, temperature, time, energy, and distance — all have magnitude but **no direction**.

> [!def]
> $\LARGE \textbf{Vectors}$
>
> Vectors are quantities described by both **magnitude** and **direction**.  
>
> Examples: displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force — all have *both* magnitude and direction.
