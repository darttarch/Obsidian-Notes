$\LARGE \sup{X}:$
If a set is bounded above, then the supremum is a number that is greater then every element of the set.

$\LARGE \inf{X}:$
If a set is bounded below, then the Infimum is a number that is less than every element of the set.

$\LARGE \max{X}:$
the maximum of a set is basically the supremum if it was included in the set.

$\LARGE \min{X}:$
the minimum of a set is basically the Infimum if it was included in the set.
