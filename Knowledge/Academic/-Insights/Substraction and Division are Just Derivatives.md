After studying about the axiomatic system of the real numbers, i realized that the substraction operation is nothing but adding the additive inverse, and the division operation is nothing but multiplying by the multiplicative inverse.
$$\huge
a-b = a+(-b)
$$
and 
$$\huge
\frac{a}{b} = a\cdot b^{-1}
$$
