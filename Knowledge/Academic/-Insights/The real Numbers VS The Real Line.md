When we have a set satisfying the filed,order and the completeness axioms, then what we have is called a $\textbf{structure}$.
The set of the real numbers $\mathbb{R}_n$ does satisfy have that structure, but so does the set of points in the real line $\mathbb{R}_p$, yet those two sets are not identical despite them having the exact same structure, so what this means os the there is a bijection 
$$
\Huge f: \mathbb{R}_n \to \mathbb{R}_p
$$
preserving the arithmetic and order operation, such bijection is called an $\textbf{Isomorphism}$.
